# kOS
Hello everybody! With this project I am getting myself into OS development. And I will do this by writing a small OS. kOS stands for kschmidster OS. Yeah, I know very creativ. The OS will not have many features. For at most it will have a terminal like 'GUI' if you will, and you will only be able to do the most basic things. We will see where it leads me, but my goal here is just to learn more about OS development.

**Discaimer:** The code I am writting here might not be optimal or even correct. So if you run this code on your machine it could potentially harm your hardware. I do not take any responsibilities if your hardware breaks.
